# LUDE — Linux Utility Debian Edition

⚠️ **Work in Progress**

LUDE is a modular post-install toolkit for Debian — focused on web design, programming, and digital creativity.

🎯 **What’s coming in the next few days:**
- `lude.sh` script with `--web` flag (web/dev tools)
- In future releases: `--3d`, `--dev`, `--ai` flags
- Custom dashboard, helper scripts, and more

Stay tuned! I'll publish the full script and detailed blog series this week.
